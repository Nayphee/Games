# Games
Console games and other coding frivolities

NOT GPL, but may be used and freely downloaded.
However, may not be modified, republished, redistributed, or sold without permission.

Some of the games are in Japanese and I never bothered to put to translate the text into English. English speakers were not the target market at the time.
